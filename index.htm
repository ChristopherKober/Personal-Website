    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <article>
    <p>I am a junior at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Science in
      the McCormick School of Engineering. I am actively looking for a summer
      internship opportunity in the area of software development in the San
      Francisco Bay Area.</p>

    <p>I have a passion for development and programming and have worked
      diligently to develop my skills both through work experience and
      independent development over the several years. I am an innovative,
      efficient and flexible developer. As part of my Computer Science
      background, I have programming experience in Python, C/C++, Unix, x86
      architecture and assembly language, PostgreSQL, Xcode, Swift, Matlab, and
      DrRacket. I have all of my projects, both academic and independent
      projects on my github page.</p>

    <p>In addition to my programming skills, I also possess very strong analytic
      skills and a solid foundation in mathematics through calculus and
      differential equations. I am currently enrolled in a number of advanced
      math and engineering courses to further my problem solving skills and am
      pursuing a Managerial Analytics Certificate from the Kellogg School of
      Management.</p>

    <p>I am proficient in Excel, Word and PowerPoint and have used these
      applications extensively in my coursework and projects. I have
      demonstrated programming and project experience from my Design Thinking
      and Communication course where I worked in small teams to design, develop
      and prototype products to solve specific customer needs. I am motivated,
      confident and proactive, and I work well in both team and individual
      roles. I also have a good sense of humor and am able to work effectively
      with a wide variety of people and personalities.</p>
